# Account setup and billing

### Lossless Account

social.io is a product by [Lossless GmbH](https://lossless.com). As such you need a Lossless Account to use [social.io](https://social.io).

### Social.io Instances

social.io uses instances to separate customers. A customer is tied to one Lossless account that has owner rights over that instance. It is easily possible to assign a new owner should you wish to transfer ownership of the instance to another account. There is only one owner. You can have multiple admins however that can configure your instance.

The following properties are always tied to an instance and not to individual users of that instance:

1. unique subdomain like [lossless.social.io](https://lossless.social.io)
2. an admin dashboard that configures ingestion routes to your instance

{% hint style="info" %}
For a fee of 1â‚¬/month you may secure your subdomain across all of Lossless GmbH's apps in case it is still available.
{% endhint %}
