# Account setup and billing

### Lossless Account

social.io is a product by [Lossless GmbH](https://lossless.com). As such you need a Lossless Account to use [social.io](https://social.io).

### Social.io Instances

To understand how social.io works, know the following:

* social.io uses **organizations** to **separate customers**.
* An **organization** is a **Lossless wide entity** and has unique subdomain across all business apps made by Lossless. _\(Learn more at_ [_https://lossless.org_](https://lossless.org)_\)_
* An organization belongs to one or more Lossless Accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
To use social.io you need to setup a Lossless organization.
{% endhint %}

An organization that uses social.io has...

* ... a unique subdomain like [lossless.social.io](https://lossless.social.io)
* ... an admin dashboard that configures your instance, e.g. ingestion routes. 

An organization that does not use any Lossless services may secure a subdomain and therefore avoid deletion for a fee of 1€/month. Visit [https://lossless.org](https://lossless.org) for more information.

### Billing

social.io is billed either through ...

* ... invoiced with prepayment through **paddle.com** for customers with up to 10 users. Any billing issues are handled by paddle.com support staff. Also your legal billing partner will be paddle.com.
* ... invoiced with postpayment by BitPerfect OÜ, our European enterprise MSP for customers with more than 10  agents. Your billing contact will be BitPerfect OÜ.

In either case you can manage billing and invoices at [https://lossless.org/billing](https://lossless.org/billing)
