# Account setup and billing

### Lossless Account

social.io is a product by [Lossless GmbH](https://lossless.com). As such you need a Lossless Account to use [social.io](https://social.io).

### Social.io Instances

social.io uses instances to separate customers. A customer is tied to one Lossless account that has owner rights over that instance. It is easily possible to assign a new owner should you wish to transfer ownership of the instance to another account. There is only one owner. You can have multiple admins however that can configure your instance.

The following properties are always tied to an instance and not to individual users of that instance:

1. unique subdomain like [lossless.social.io](https://lossless.social.io)
2. an admin dashboard that configures ingestion routes to your instance

{% hint style="info" %}
For a fee of 1€/month you may secure your subdomain across all of Lossless GmbH's apps in case it is still available.
{% endhint %}

### Billing

social.io is billed either through ...

* ... invoiced with prepayment through **paddle.com** for customers with up to 10 users. Any billing issues are handled by paddle.com support staff. Also your legal billing partner will be paddle.com.
* ... invoiced with postpayment by BitPerfect OÜ, our European enterprise MSP for customers with more than 10  agents. Your billing contact will be BitPerfect OÜ.

In either case you can manage billing and invoices at [billing.lossless.com](https://billing.lossless.com)
